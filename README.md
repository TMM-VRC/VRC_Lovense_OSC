# VRC_Lovense_OSC
A kinda bad, thrown together way to control lovense toys (and possibly others) from vrc 

Better instructions and info on the unity setup coming later 

------------------------------------------------------------

Setup Guide (check the "Help Images" folder for example images):


------------Step 1------------  
Go to https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop/releases  
Download and install the latest version with .exe at thhe end of the name (Example: intiface-desktop-27.0.0-win.exe)  

When its done installing you can close the window/application  

  

------------Step 2------------  
Go to https://github.com/AlexanderPavlenko/buttplug-osc/releases  
Download the latest version with .exe at thhe end of the name (Example: buttplug-osc.exe)  

When its done downloading, move the downloaded .exe into the same folder as this README file  

  

------------Step 3------------  
Install the "Lovense Connect" app on your phone  
Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lovense.connect  
Apple: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lovense-connect/id1273067916  

When its installed you can connect your toy in the app  

  

------------Step 4------------  
To create a shortcut that can be placed anywhere or pinned to the taskbar,
double click/run the file named "Create_Shortcut.bat"

A shortcut named "Start_VRC_Lovense_OSC" should appear in the folder

  

------------Step 5------------  
Now you are all setup. You should be able to drag or copy the shortcut anywhere,
and then click or double click it to start everything.
You can also start it by just using the shortcut in the same folder or double click/run the "Start.bat" file
